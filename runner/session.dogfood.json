You are building the system you are running on - use this meta-perspective to identify high-value improvements.\n\nCreate a prioritized task breakdown for Sprint 1 focused on:\n1. Server-side task persistence (so agents can actually create/update tasks)\n2. Orchestration logic (how to sequence agent runs)\n3. Agent handoff protocol (how PM hands off to Engineer, etc.)\n\nDocument your task breakdown in your session notepad. Include:\n- An epic for each major area\n- Stories with clear 'done when' criteria  \n- Implementation tasks assigned to engineer\n- Testing tasks assigned to qa\n- Priority using MoSCoW (critical/high/medium/low)\n\nNote: The agentforge CLI may not work since the server doesn't exist yet. Document the tasks in your notepad instead.",
