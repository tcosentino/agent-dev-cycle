# TaskFlow - Project Briefing

## Customer
Acme Consulting -- 25-person consulting firm. Primary contact: Sarah Chen (Operations Manager).

## Problem
Consultants track tasks across spreadsheets, Slack messages, and sticky notes. No single source of truth for what needs to get done. Tasks fall through the cracks when switching between clients.

## Solution
Simple personal task management web app with team visibility. Each consultant manages their own tasks; managers can see team workload.

## Success Metrics
- Consultants can create and manage tasks in under 30 seconds
- Team lead can view all active tasks across the team
- Zero tasks lost compared to current spreadsheet workflow

## Constraints
- Starter tier -- keep scope minimal
- Single auth method (email/password)
- No third-party integrations in MVP
- Must work on mobile browsers (consultants are often on-site)

## Wiki Reference
Deeper context available in the knowledge base:
- `memory/decisions.md` -- architectural and scope decisions
- `memory/codebase.md` -- codebase structure and conventions
