# AgentForge Documentation

## Executive Summary

AgentForge is an AI-powered custom software development platform that deploys a coordinated team of specialized AI agents to build software from requirements to production. Instead of a single AI assistant, AgentForge orchestrates multiple agents working together—each with distinct roles and responsibilities—to deliver complete software solutions.

### The AI Team

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Product Manager** | Gathers requirements, creates project plans, prioritizes features |
| **Engineer** | Builds and implements code, APIs, database schemas, and UI components |
| **QA Engineer** | Tests and validates all artifacts, ensures quality standards |
| **Tech Lead** | Coordinates the team, reviews work, makes architectural decisions |

### How It Works

1. **Requirements Gathering** — The PM agent engages with stakeholders to understand needs
2. **Project Planning** — Requirements are broken into actionable tasks on a Kanban board
3. **Development** — Engineers build artifacts (APIs, jobs, databases, UI) in parallel
4. **Quality Assurance** — QA validates everything before delivery

### Key Benefits

- **End-to-end automation** — From idea to working software
- **Specialized expertise** — Each agent focuses on what it does best
- **Built-in quality** — QA is integrated into the workflow, not an afterthought
- **Transparent process** — Watch the team collaborate in real-time

### Vision: From Computer to Team

Claude Code's breakthrough was giving Claude a computer—direct access to a shell, filesystem, and development tools. This transformed Claude from a conversational assistant into an agent that could actually build software.

AgentForge takes the next step: **giving Claude Code a team**.

Instead of a single agent with a computer, AgentForge provides an entire development team—a PM to gather requirements, engineers to build, QA to validate, and a tech lead to coordinate. Each agent has its own specialty while the system orchestrates collaboration.

| Evolution | Capability |
|-----------|------------|
| Claude | Conversational AI that can discuss code |
| Claude Code | Agent with a computer that can write and run code |
| AgentForge | Agent with a team that can produce complete software |

This isn't just about doing more—it's about doing things differently. A team doesn't just write more code faster; it brings diverse perspectives, enforces quality standards, and coordinates parallel workstreams that a single developer (human or AI) simply cannot.
