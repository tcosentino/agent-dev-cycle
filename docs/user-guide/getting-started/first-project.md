# Your First Project

> **Note:** This document describes the planned project creation experience. Some CLI commands and workflows described here are not yet implemented. See the [Development Setup](../../developer-guide/development-setup.md) for current instructions.

Create your first AgentForge project and watch agents build software for you.

**Time:** 10 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** [AgentForge installed](./installation.md)

## Overview

In this guide, you'll:
1. Create a new project
2. Define your first agent
3. Create a task for the agent
4. Watch the agent complete the task
5. Review the results

## Step 1: Create a Project

### Using the Web UI

1. Open AgentForge UI at `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click **"New Project"** button
3. Fill in the project details:
   - **Name:** My First Project
   - **Description:** Learning AgentForge basics
   - **Repository:** Choose existing or create new

4. Click **"Create Project"**

The wizard will guide you through:
- **GitHub connection** (optional)
- **Initial setup** (AI-generated PROJECT.md)
- **First tasks** (automatically created)

### Using the CLI

Prefer the command line? No problem:

```bash
# Create a new project
agentforge project create

# Follow the prompts
? Project name: my-first-project
? Description: Learning AgentForge basics
? Repository: [create new] ~/repos/my-first-project
? Initialize with AI setup? Yes

✓ Project created!
✓ Repository initialized at ~/repos/my-first-project
✓ Agent templates created
✓ 3 initial tasks generated
```

## Step 2: Understand Your Project Structure

Navigate to your project directory:

```bash
cd ~/repos/my-first-project
ls -la
```

You'll see:

```
my-first-project/
├── .agentforge/           # AgentForge metadata
│   ├── agents/            # Agent definitions
│   │   ├── architect.md
│   │   ├── engineer.md
│   │   └── qa.md
│   ├── tasks/             # Task definitions
│   └── project.yaml       # Project config
├── PROJECT.md             # Project overview (for agents)
├── AGENTS.md              # Agent guidelines
├── README.md
└── src/                   # Your code (generated by agents)
```

### Key Files

**PROJECT.md** - Tells agents what this project is:
```markdown
# My First Project

## Overview
A simple web application to learn AgentForge basics.

## Architecture
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: PostgreSQL

## Goals
- Build a todo list app
- Learn agent-driven development
- Practice with AgentForge workflows
```

**AGENTS.md** - Guidelines for agents working on this project:
```markdown
# Agent Guidelines

## Your Role
You are working on a web application project.

## Conventions
- Commit messages: conventional commits
- Branch naming: feature/task-name
- Testing: write tests for new features

## Boundaries
- Don't delete existing code without confirming
- Don't make destructive changes
- Ask if uncertain
```

## Step 3: Create Your First Task

Tasks tell agents what to build. Let's create one:

### In the UI

1. Go to your project in AgentForge
2. Click the **"Tasks"** tab
3. Click **"New Task"**
4. Fill in the details:
   - **Title:** Set up basic project structure
   - **Description:** Create package.json, install React, set up basic folder structure
   - **Type:** Backend
   - **Priority:** High
   - **Assignee:** Engineer

5. Click **"Create Task"**

Your task gets a unique key like `MFP-1` (My First Project - 1).

### In the CLI

```bash
# Create a task
agentforge task create \
  --title "Set up basic project structure" \
  --description "Create package.json, install React, set up basic folder structure" \
  --type backend \
  --priority high

# Task created: MFP-1
```

## Step 4: Run Your First Agent

Now the exciting part - let an agent complete the task!

### In the UI

1. Go to **Tasks** tab
2. Find task `MFP-1`
3. Click **"Assign to Agent"**
4. Select **"Engineer"** agent
5. Click **"Start"**

You'll see:
- **Real-time progress** - Agent's thinking and actions
- **File changes** - What the agent is creating/modifying
- **Git commits** - Automatic commits as work progresses

### In the CLI

```bash
# Run the engineer agent on task MFP-1
agentforge run --task MFP-1 --agent engineer

# Watch the agent work...
🤖 Engineer agent starting on MFP-1
📝 Reading PROJECT.md and AGENTS.md
💭 Planning approach...
✓ Created package.json
✓ Installed React dependencies
✓ Created src/ folder structure
✓ Created basic App.jsx
✓ Committed changes: "feat: set up basic project structure"

✅ Task MFP-1 complete!
```

## Step 5: Review the Results

### Check the Changes

```bash
# See what the agent created
git log

# View the latest commit
git show HEAD

# See the new files
ls -R src/
```

### In the UI

1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. See the deployment created by the agent
3. Click on the deployment to see:
   - **Files created**
   - **Dependencies installed**
   - **Tests run** (if any)
   - **Logs** from the agent

### Test the Code

The agent should have created runnable code:

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Start the dev server
npm run dev

# Open browser to http://localhost:5173
```

You should see your React app running!

## Step 6: Iterate

Now you've seen the basics. Let's add another feature:

```bash
# Create a new task
agentforge task create \
  --title "Add todo list functionality" \
  --description "Create components for adding, displaying, and completing todos"

# Run the engineer agent again
agentforge run --task MFP-2 --agent engineer

# Watch it build the feature!
```

## What You've Learned

✅ Created your first AgentForge project  
✅ Defined agents and tasks  
✅ Watched an agent complete a task  
✅ Reviewed agent-generated code  
✅ Ran the resulting application

## Understanding What Happened

### The Agent Workflow

1. **Agent reads context** - PROJECT.md, AGENTS.md, existing code
2. **Agent plans approach** - Breaks down the task
3. **Agent writes code** - Creates/modifies files
4. **Agent tests** - Runs tests (if configured)
5. **Agent commits** - Automatic Git commits
6. **Agent reports** - Marks task complete

### Why It Works

- **Clear context** - PROJECT.md tells agents what to build
- **Good prompts** - Agent definitions guide behavior
- **Structured tasks** - Clear, specific task descriptions
- **Iteration** - Agents build incrementally

## Common Questions

### Can I edit agent-generated code?

**Yes!** The code is yours. Agents commit to Git, so you can:
- Edit code manually
- Review agent changes in PRs
- Revert if needed
- Collaborate with agents

### What if the agent makes a mistake?

```bash
# Revert the last commit
git revert HEAD

# Or undo changes
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Then try again or edit manually
```

### Can multiple agents work together?

**Yes!** Assign different agents to different tasks:
- **Architect** - System design
- **Engineer** - Write code
- **QA** - Write tests
- **Lead** - Review code

They'll coordinate through Git and task dependencies.
